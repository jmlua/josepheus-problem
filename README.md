Josephine is a beautiful princess. She's so beautiful that there are N princes proposing to her. 

After lots of consideration, Josephine and her parents realized that all these princes are perfect, so that it is impossible to choose one and reject the others with a good reason. They decided that Josephine would not reject the one chosen by Fate, while other princes could not ask for a fairer decision.

The N princes, numbered from 1 to N, are asked to stand in a circle. Our beautiful princess would choose a random positive number K and begin to find her fiancé with that number. Starting from the first person, she counted to K, and removed that K‐th person from the circle. Then, she starts counting from the next person and removes the K‐th person. This process is repeated until all candidates are removed but The Chosen One.
